## Customization & Extensibility with AL (Continued)

### Developing with AL

To customize and extend Business Central with AL, you'll need a development environment set up, which includes:

* **Visual Studio Code:** A lightweight and versatile code editor that provides a great foundation for AL development.
* **AL Language Extension:** This extension for Visual Studio Code adds support for AL syntax highlighting, code completion, debugging, and other essential development features.

Once your environment is set up, you can start developing AL code. The typical development workflow involves:

1. **Creating AL objects:** You'll define tables, pages, codeunits, and reports using AL syntax.
2. **Writing AL code:** You'll implement the business logic within codeunits, define page layouts and interactions, and create reports to visualize data.
3. **Testing and debugging:** You'll test your AL code within Business Central's sandbox environment to identify and fix errors.
4. **Deploying extensions:** Once your code is tested and working, you'll package it into an extension and deploy it to a production environment.

### Learning Resources

Microsoft offers comprehensive resources to help you get started with AL development:

* **Microsoft Learn:** The official learning platform provides step-by-step tutorials, videos, and hands-on exercises to teach you the basics of AL and Business Central development. Start with the "Programming in AL" module: [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-programming-in-al](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/business-central/dev-itpro/developer/devenv-programming-in-al)
* **Microsoft Docs:** The official documentation for Business Central contains in-depth information about AL syntax, objects, and development best practices.
* **Business Central Community:** This online forum is a great place to ask questions, get help from other developers, and share your knowledge.

## Best Practices for Business Central Development

* **Start with standard configurations:** Before diving into customization, familiarize yourself with the standard functionality offered by Business Central. This will help you understand what can be achieved out of the box and what needs customization.
* **Plan your customizations:** Before writing any code, carefully plan the changes you want to make. Create a list of requirements, design mockups of new pages or reports, and outline the business logic you need to implement.
* **Follow coding standards:** Adhere to established coding standards and best practices to ensure your code is clean, maintainable, and easy to understand.
* **Test thoroughly:** Test your code thoroughly in a sandbox environment before deploying it to production. This will help you catch errors early on and avoid disruptions to your business operations.
* **Keep up-to-date:** Business Central is constantly evolving, so make sure to stay updated on the latest features and best practices by following Microsoft's documentation and community resources.
